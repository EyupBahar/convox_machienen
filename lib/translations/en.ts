CONSTMACH Jaw Crushers are used as the first stage crushers in our stationary and mobile type crushing plants. High flywheel speeds, jaw angles, safety plates and rear blocks, high performances arised from special geometries, reliability, strength and user friendly setting mechanisms of our Jaw Crushers offer excellent operational advantages to the users. All our Jaw Crushers are equipped with hydraulic setting mechanisms. The hydraulic setting mechanism enables to set the jaw gap according to the requested final product fraction size. Features of CONSTMACH JAW CRUSHERS: Heavy-duty base frame is submerged, arc-welded, then thermally stress relieved. Oversized, heavy-duty spherical, self-aligning roller bearings. Pitmans of our Jaw Crushers are able to absorbe the heaviest loads thanks to its drop-forged chrome-nickel steel casting material. In case of need, CONSTMACH Jaw Crushers are equipped with automatic lubrication systems. Large flywheels to ensure the inertia is maintained to crush even the hardest materials."
